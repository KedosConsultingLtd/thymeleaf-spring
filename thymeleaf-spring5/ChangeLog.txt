3.0.9
=====
- Fixed bean validation mechanism trying to create BindStatus for unbound objects because of an improper use of
  a Spring 5 validation API.
- Fixed RequestDataValueProcessor not being applied in Spring WebFlux applications.
- Adapted Spring-based tag processors to new scenarios for restricted expression evaluation.


3.0.8
=====
- Fix RequestDataValueProcessor being called without a default "action" attribute (with GET value) for
  forms that included th:action, which resulted in CSRF token being added as a request parameter to the URL
  in some scenarios.
- Added "th:uerrors" attribute in order to easily output all selected errors without escaping the error messages.
- Added "fullModeViewNames" and "chunkedModeViewNames" properties to ThymeleafReactiveViewResolver so that
  the way the "maxResponseChunkSize" property is applied to templates can be fine-tuned. Templates can now be forced
  to be executed in FULL mode, or specific sets of templates can be selected to be the only ones executed as CHUNKED.
- Improved DATA-DRIVEN mode behaviour so that it now causes a flush of the server's output channels for every
  output chunk produced (even if no max response chunk size has been set).
- Added the SpringWebFluxContext class as a base implementation of ISpringWebFluxContext, useful for calling the
  SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine cleanly from outside a ThymeleafReactiveView.
- Added the capability to set a prefix to the names and IDs of SSE events, so that HTML events coming from different
  executions of Thymeleaf in DATA-DRIVEN mode can be combined at the controller for UI composition in a single
  event stream and then easily discriminated at the JavaScript side by the corresponding EventSource objects.
- Removed the ReactiveLazyContextVariable context variable wrapper in order to avoid confusion with the way
  lazy evaluation of non-data-driven reactive variables worked.
- Set the default size of the buffers of elements generated by the data driver in DATA-DRIVEN mode to 10.
- Updated Spring Framework dependencies to 5.0.0.RELEASE.
- Updated SLF4j dependency to 1.7.25.


3.0.7.RC1
=========
- Fixed exception being thrown when more than one ConversionService is available at the application context
  (e.g. in scenarios where Spring Cloud Stream is present).


3.0.6.M4
========
- Added automatic negotiation of ContentType at the ViewResolver depending on view name (file extension).
- Improved instances of dynamic class loading by making references package-relative for better resilience
  to package renaming.


3.0.5.M3
========
- (No changes)


3.0.4.M2
========
- Improved startup times at the template engine by means of lazy initialization of dialect artifacts.
- Improve behaviour of SpringContextUtils.getApplicationContext(): avoided cast exception when ApplicationContext
  is not available.
- Added support for rendering Server-Sent Events (SSE) with content-type "text/event-stream" in Spring 5 WebFlux
  when Thymeleaf is executing in reactive-friendly data-driven mode.
- Updated Spring Framework dependency to 5.0.0.M5.


3.0.3.M1
========
- First release of thymeleaf-spring5, includes
  * Support for Spring 5 Web MVC
  * Support for Spring 5 Web Reactive
